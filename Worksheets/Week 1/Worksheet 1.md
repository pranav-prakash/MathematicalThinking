Question 1
=========
Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence `The man saw
the woman with a telescope`, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman
has the telescope.

Answer:
------

1. The man with the telescope saw the woman
2. The man saw the woman and her telescope

Question 2
=========
For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way
that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

1. Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
3. Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

Answer:
------

1. After ten years apart, sisters reunited in Safeway checkout line
2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are investigating the matter.
3. Mayor says bus passengers should wear seat belts.

Question 3
=========

The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room: `No head injury is too trivial to ignore.`
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

Answer:
------

The alternate, unintended meaning is that "any head injury, no matter how trivial it is, should be ignored". 

To see why, compare to a similar phrase: "No mountain is too tall to climb." which imples that "any mountain, no matter how tall it is, can be climbed"

This can be fixed by changing the "ignore" to "treat" giving:

"No head injury is to trivial to treat"

Question 4
=========

You often see the following notice posted in elevators: `In case of fire, do not use elevator.`
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended
second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

Answer:
------

The unintended meaning is best explained by this humorous image:

Fixed by saying "In case of fire, use stairs to exit."

Question 5
=========

Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the
bottom: `This page intentionally left blank.`
Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement?
What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again,
the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no
problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth
century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in
an entire branch of mathematics.)

Answer:
------

Obviously the page cannot be blank if there is that text written on it.

Can be rephrased as "Rest of this page intentionally left blank"

Question 6
=========

Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is
(clearly) not what the writer intended. (This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is
very common.)

SKIP

Question 7
=========

Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this
all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in
mathematics would be disastrous.

Answer:
------

Temperature cannot be described by hot/cold. Only the environment can.

Question 8
=========

How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 · p2 · p3 · . . . · pn) + 1 is prime,
where p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn , . . . is the list of all prime numbers?

Answer:
------

Counterexample:

PrimeQ[2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 + 1] = false

JUST FOR FUN

Question 1
=========

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the word `and` occurs five times in
succession, with no other word between those five occurrences. (You are allowed to use punctuation.)

Answer:
------

Use the words "Bob and", "and and", and "and Joe" in a sentence.

(Perhaps there is a more elegant construction, like [Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBuffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo&ei=mQTpVJS_CNfZoASVxYDwDg&usg=AFQjCNGKsSiS84t8ZxfvqJ62vagdaQlVLw&sig2=8bSEG798E0I4inEJbxryyQ)

Question 2
=========

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the words `and`, `or`, `and`, `or`, `and` occur
in that order, with no other word between them. (Again, you can use punctuation.)

Answer:
------

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the words `and`, `or`, `and`, `or`, `and` occur
in that order, with no other word between them.

^^ Yes, the very question itself is an answer.
